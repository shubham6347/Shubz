# AWS & DevOps Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is AWS Fargate?

**Answer:** AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for Amazon ECS and EKS. It allows you to run containers without managing EC2 instances. AWS provisions and manages the infrastructure automatically.

---

### 2. What is Amazon ECS?

**Answer:** Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you deploy, manage, and scale Docker containers on AWS.

---

### 3. What are ACLs? What does enabled or disabled mean?

**Answer:**

* **ACL (Access Control List):** A set of rules that define permissions for users or groups on a system.
* **Enabled:** ACLs are applied to resources.
* **Disabled:** ACLs are ignored.

---

### 4. What is bucket versioning?

**Answer:**

* **Enabled:** Keeps multiple variants of an object in a bucket, allowing retrieval of every version.
* **Suspended:** Stops creating new versions but retains old versions.
* **Disabled:** Once enabled, it cannot be fully disabled—only suspended.

### 5. What is an AMI?

**Answer:** An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a preconfigured virtual machine template used to launch EC2 instances.

---

### 6. What is the difference between EBS and S3?

**Answer:**

* **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Like a virtual hard disk attached to servers. Low-latency, good for databases and frequent read/write apps. Max size: 16TB per volume.
* **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Object-based storage for storing files, backups, and static content.

---

### 7. What are Read Replicas in RDS?

**Answer:** Read replicas are copies of the primary database that allow scaling of read-heavy workloads. You can create up to 5 read replicas in Amazon RDS.

---

### 8. What is Amazon Athena?

**Answer:** A serverless query service that allows you to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using SQL.

---

### 9. What is the difference between NAT Instance and NAT Gateway?

**Answer:**

* **NAT Gateway:** Fully managed by AWS, highly available, scales automatically.
* **NAT Instance:** EC2 instance configured as a NAT. Requires manual management, less scalable.

---

### 10. What is AWS CloudTrail?

**Answer:** AWS CloudTrail is a logging service that records API calls made within an AWS account.

---

### 11. If a Jenkins pipeline crashes, how do you fix it?

**Answer:**

* Open Jenkins dashboard → Select failed build.
* Check console output for error messages.
* Identify and fix the root cause (e.g., misconfiguration, dependency failure).

---

### 12. How do you troubleshoot a Linux server that is running out of space?

**Answer:**

1. Check disk space → `df -h`
2. Identify large files → `du -sh /path/to/dir`
3. Check logs → `ls -lh /var/log`
4. Clear unnecessary files in `/var/log` and `/tmp`

---

### 13. How do you secure a Linux server?

**Answer:**

* Regularly update system (`yum update`, `apt-get update`)
* Disable root login in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
* Configure firewalls (`iptables`, `firewalld`)
* Use SSH key-based authentication

---

### 14. A deployment failed in production. How do you troubleshoot?

**Answer:**

* Check application and deployment logs (e.g., Jenkins logs, `/var/log/`)
* Identify issues (misconfiguration, missing dependencies, resource limits)
* Rollback and revert to previous stable version

---

### 15. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

**Answer:**

* **TCP:** Connection-oriented, reliable, ensures data delivery.
* **UDP:** Connectionless, faster, less reliable, no guaranteed delivery.

---

### 16. What is a Proxy Server?

**Answer:**

* **Proxy Server:** Acts as intermediary between client and server.
* **Reverse Proxy:** Forwards client requests to backend servers. Example: AWS ALB, API Gateway.

---

### 17. What is the difference between Process and Service?

**Answer:**

* **Process:** Running instance of a program, identified by a unique PID.
* **Service:** Long-running background process that provides functionality (e.g., `sshd`).

---

### 18. What are some important Linux commands for DevOps?

* `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` → Add user to docker group
* `ps aux` → Show active processes
* `kill -9 <PID>` → Kill process by PID
* `pkill <name>` → Kill process by name
* `nohup <cmd> &` → Run process in background
* `grep -i "error" /path/file.log` → Search for errors in file
* `tar -xvzf backup.tar.gz` → Extract backup
* `netstat -tuln` → Show listening ports
* `curl -I https://google.com` → Fetch HTTP headers
* `shutdown -h now` → Shutdown immediately
* `rsync -av source/ backup/` → Sync files
* `scp file.txt user@host:/path/` → Secure copy over SSH

---

### 19. What is Load Balancing vs Failover?

**Answer:**

* **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance.
* **Failover:** Switches to backup system when primary fails, ensuring high availability.

---

### 20. How can you encrypt data in AWS?

**Answer:**

* **At rest:** Use AWS KMS for encryption of data stored in S3, EBS, RDS.
* **In transit:** Use TLS/SSL to protect data while moving across networks.
