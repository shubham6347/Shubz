Ok now what the isuue solved recently in ur org how you fixed whats the conclusion u got ?
architecture of k8s ?
what is orchestation ?
what r the things u have worked on terraform?
what is count function in terraform?
any other way to do it like in looping ?
write trafform code for ec2 and provider as well?
lets take there 20 resources created and i want destroy only one resource how can do it ?
what is saas paas IAAS ?
could u explain the entire flow of your ci cd pipleine ?
where dev write the code how he will commit it then how pipline trigger like i want to know which branch he will commit the how he will commt te and jenkins pipeline runs ?

*** Round 1 ***
How prometheus sending those logs to kibana ?
is prometheus sending those logs to grafana of grafana taking it? 
lets take u r creating dashbord in grfana how graphana knows that is metric in promethus how he knows that he has take logs from that. 
lets take only cpu or memory realted data how kibana knows that he has take data from that.
Let's say. I nave deployed API in Kubernetes. And it is running database. Okay. so, What are all the components that are needed? F actively. Serve the request that is coming from outside lines
The API is running. The API is running in a Kubernetes cluster in a place.
Okay, so I am a client. I'm coming to you. I need To access that APA. Okay. So, you need to configure. Multiple things. For that. So that I will be able to access it because they is currently running in the AWS. That is a private. Your private VPC. I am a public user, I need to access it. So what are all the
So what are all the components that are needed that you need to configure? So that I will be A able to access your API.
A load balancer. You have created in that is AWS component. In Kubernetes You have created the increase of created the service
okay, so now you have created a service load balancer service When you create a Load Balancer service. So what will be created in the AWS side? There will be a lot.
Okay. Now let's say you have created a, what kind of Like in Route, 53 water. All the things, you will provide for that.
Okay. So, in DNS. so, In a Linux machine. Let's say you have a instance created. And you need that instance to use a particular DNS. So, how you will configure that?
yeah, there is a DNS server, let's say, you have you are hosting a DNS and you have a different DNS server and you have you need your PC to instance, to use your DNS server. How you will be able to achieve that? 
Okay, you have DNS server. You have created a DNS server. Okay, and you have created a easy to instance. That is a Linux instance: 80 you want your Linux instance to use the DNS server that you have created? For the name resolution. So, how you will achieve that?
Okay. Let's say you need to find a particular file. In a directory. How do you do that? What is the command?
So, how you will be able to filter out a single line? Using our command
If you put dollar one, Will it print? First. Line, or first column.
which is commnd to give as a single line out put from file
there are two files which contains 150 lines in one file and other file contain 200 lines how will find out that 50 different lines which not in file 1
What is xarg command do?

*** Round 2 ***
